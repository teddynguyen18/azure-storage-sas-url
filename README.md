# azure-storage-sas-url

Small library to generate sas url with @azure/storage-blob.

I was trying to use @azure/storage-blob to generate sas url for my project and I did found it is not easy compare to S3.getSignedUrl in aws-sdk, it took me a bit of time to find how to generate sas parameters with @azure/storage-blob. Hope this library/example code will save your time.
